Notes on Azure
Virtual Machine types:
Reference: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/virtual-machines/series/
Create a vm depending on your workload requirement and choose configure access to the vm by using ASG and NSG.

AZURE VNET:
ASG: This is used to group diff application or vm to a consolidated set of security group.
It enhances NSG, you'll have to use ASG in collaboration with NSG. ASG will select all vm and you can use NSG to set traffic flow from ASG security group.


**Azure Virtual Network (VNet):**
A VNet is an isolated network within the Azure cloud that allows various Azure resources, such as VMs (Virtual Machines), to securely communicate with each other,
the internet, and on-premises networks. It's the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure.

**Network Security Groups (NSG):**
NSGs are used to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure VNet. An NSG can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules that allow
or deny traffic based on several parameters, such as protocol, port, and source or destination IP address. NSGs can be associated with subnets
in the VNet or directly to individual resources.

**Application Security Groups (ASG):**
ASGs are a feature that enhances the capabilities of NSGs, allowing you to define fine-grained network security policies based on workloads or applications.
 Instead of defining rules based on IP addresses, you can group virtual machines and define network security policies based on these groups.
 This abstraction simplifies the management and maintenance of network security rules, as you don't need to update rules when adding or removing VMs in your application group.

**How ASGs Enhance NSGs:**
ASGs are used in conjunction with NSGs to refine how security rules are applied. When you associate a VM to an ASG,
you can then use that ASG as a source or destination in NSG security rules. This setup allows for more granular control over
traffic flow between different groups of VMs or applications within your Azure VNet. For instance, you can easily allow communication
between your front-end and back-end layers without having to specify individual IP addresses.

By utilizing ASGs with NSGs, you can:
- Dynamically manage security policies as you scale your environment up or down.
- Apply and maintain security rules more efficiently by grouping VMs according to their roles, applications, or workloads.
- Improve the clarity of your security rules, making it easier to understand and audit the traffic flow within your VNet.

In summary, ASGs help organize your virtual machines into logical groups that can be referenced in NSG rules, simplifying the management
and application of network security policies in a dynamic cloud environment.



Important:
  A firewall and a Web Application Firewall (WAF) serve different purposes, and in the context of Azure, they are distinct offerings designed
  for different security needs.

### Azure Firewall

Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It's a stateful firewall
as a service with built-in high availability and

unrestricted cloud scalability. Azure Firewall provides outbound, inbound, and network-level traffic filtering and monitoring.
 It can filter traffic between resources in a VNet, from the internet to the VNet, and even between different VNets. Key features include:
- **FQDN filtering in network rules**
- **Network traffic filtering rules**
- **SNAT support for outbound internet connectivity**
- **Integrated threat intelligence based on Microsoft Threat Intelligence**
- **High availability built-in**
- **Unrestricted cloud scalability**

### Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a specialized form of firewall focused on securing web applications. It is offered as part of Azure Application Gateway,
 Azure Front Door Service, and Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) services. WAF is designed to protect web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities,
 such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other web-based attacks. WAF operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
 and uses rules from the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) core rule sets to identify and block malicious traffic. Key features include:
- **Protection against web vulnerabilities and attacks**
- **Custom rules and managed rule sets**
- **Monitoring and logging capabilities**
- **Integration with Azure Application Gateway, Front Door, and CDN**

### Key Differences

- **Scope of Protection**: Azure Firewall provides broad network-level protection and monitoring for resources within
Azure Virtual Networks, including filtering outbound, inbound, and internal network traffic. On the other hand, Azure WAF
 is specifically designed to protect web applications from common web vulnerabilities and attacks.
- **Layer of Operation**: Azure Firewall operates at the network layer (Layers 3 and 4), while Azure WAF operates at the
application layer (Layer 7) to inspect HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
- **Use Cases**: Use Azure Firewall when you need general network security and traffic filtering for all types of resources in your VNet.
 Choose Azure WAF when you specifically need to protect web applications from attacks and vulnerabilities.

In summary, while both services provide security features, they cater to different aspects of network and application security within Azure.
It's not uncommon for organizations to use both Azure Firewall and Azure WAF together to achieve comprehensive security coverage for their cloud resources and applications.
